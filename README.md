# EWolf-BFMC2026
Official repository for Team EWolf participating in the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge (BFMC) 2026. This project focuses on developing autonomous driving algorithms, including lane detection, traffic sign recognition, and vehicle control logic for a 1/10 scale vehicle. We are a group of Mechatronics Engineering students from the **Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP)** in Puebla, Mexico.

## About Us
* **Origin:** Puebla, Mexico.
* **Institution:** BUAP (Facultad de Ciencias de la Electrónica).
* **Focus:** Developing autonomous driving solutions through hardware integration, computer vision, and control theory.

## Current Project Status
As of December 2025:
* **Manual Control:** Successfully implemented manual vehicle control using the Bosch startup code.
* **Environment:** Setup of the development environment and initial hardware testing.
* **Next Goal:** Implementing Lane Keeping and basic obstacle reaction for the next sprint.
